# slophish
phscan is a tool that daily scans NRD databases and, based on certain keywords, displays domains in a Telegram group - https://t.me/phscan. With the help of this tool, we create the slophish list, which contains phishing domains that target Slovenian-speaking users.

The phscan tool currently scans the following keywords: 

- slovenia
- slovenija
- ljubljana
- siol
- nlb
- kbm
- bolha
- voyo
- mimo
- avto
- ezdrav
- nova
- policija
- telekom
- moj
- skb
- blokiran

The tool also inspects general words and words from the crypto world. All domains posted in the Telegram group are also manually reviewed daily. Notifications about non-slo phishing websites are posted on Twitter.
