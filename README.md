# slophish
slophish is a project of the organization Hack Protect. It is a public endeavor aimed at identifying as many new Slovenian domains as possible that may pose a potential phishing threat.

The phscan tool currently scans the following keywords: 

- slovenia
- slovenija
- ljubljana
- siol
- nlb
- kbm
- bolha
- voyo
- mimo
- avto
- ezdrav
- nova
- policija
- telekom
- moj
- skb
- blokiran

and adds potential phishing domains to the slophish list.
